"""Helpers and utilities for Sphinx rendering of CLI based on Click Extra.

.. danger::
    This module is quite janky but does the job. Still, it would benefits from a total
    clean rewrite. This would require a better understanding of Sphinx, Click and MyST
    internals. And as a side effect will eliminate the dependency on
    ``pallets_sphinx_themes``.

    If you're up to the task, you can try to refactor it. I'll probably start by moving
    the whole ``pallets_sphinx_themes.themes.click.domain`` code here, merge it with
    the local collection of monkey-patches below, then clean the whole code to make it
    more readable and maintainable. And finally, address all the todo-list below.

.. todo::
    Add support for plain MyST directives to remove the need of wrapping rST into an
    ``{eval-rst}`` block. Ideally, this would allow for the following simpler syntax in
    MyST:

    .. code-block:: markdown

        ```{click-example}
        from click_extra import echo, extra_command, option, style

        @extra_command
        @option("--name", prompt="Your name", help="The person to greet.")
        def hello_world(name):
            "Simple program that greets NAME."
            echo(f"Hello, {style(name, fg='red')}!")
        ```

    .. code-block:: markdown

        ```{click-run}
        invoke(hello_world, args=["--help"])
        ```

.. todo::
    Fix the need to have both ``.. click:example::`` and ``.. click:run::`` directives
    in the same ``{eval-rst}`` block in MyST. This is required to have both directives
    shares states and context.
