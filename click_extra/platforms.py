""" Below is the collection of heuristics used to identify each platform.

All these heuristics can be hard-cached as the underlying system is not suppose to
change between code execution.

We mostly rely on ``sys.platform`` first as it seems to be the lowest-level primitive
available to identify systems.

We choose to have separate function to detect each platform so we can easely check
consistency. It helps ensure there is no heuristics conflicting and matching multiple
systems at the same time.
