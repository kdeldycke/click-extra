        The order of options has been carefully crafted to handle subtle edge-cases and

        You can still override this hard-coded order for easthetic reasons and it
        should be fine. Your end-users are unlikely to be affected by these sneaky
        bugs, as the CLI context is going to be naturraly reset after each
        invocation (which is not the case in unitests).

    #. ``--time`` / ``--no-time``

            ``--time`` is placed at the top of all other eager options so all other

    #. ``--config CONFIG_PATH``

    #. ``--version``

            This is the option produced by the `@click.decorators.help_option
            <https://click.palletsprojects.com/en/stable/api/#click.help_option>`_
            decorator.

            It is not explicitly referenced in the implementation of this function.

            That's because it's `going to be added by Click itself
            <https://github.com/pallets/click/blob/c9f7d9d/src/click/core.py#L966-L969>`_,
            at the end of the list of options. By letting Click handle this, we ensure
            that the help option will take into account the `help_option_names
            <https://click.palletsprojects.com/en/stable/documentation/#help-parameter-customization>`_
            setting.

    .. important::
        Sensitivity to order still remains to be proven. With the code of Click Extra
        and its dependencies moving fast, there is a non-zero chance that all the
        options are now sound enough to be re-ordered in a more natural way.

    .. todo::
        For bullet-proof handling of edge-cases, we should probably add an indirection
        layer to have the processing order of options (the one below) different from
        the presentation order of options in the help screen.

        This is probably something that has been `requested in issue #544

            fixing `click#2483 issue <https://github.com/pallets/click/issues/2483>`_.
            On Windows, environment variable names are case-insensitive, so we normalize
            them to uppercase.

        By default, these `Click context settings
        <https://click.palletsprojects.com/en/stable/api/#click.Context>`_ are applied:

        - ``auto_envvar_prefix = self.name`` (*Click feature*)

          Auto-generate environment variables for all options, using the command ID as
          prefix. The prefix is normalized to be uppercased and all non-alphanumerics
          replaced by underscores.

        - ``help_option_names = ("--help", "-h")`` (*Click feature*)

          `Allow help screen to be invoked with either --help or -h options
          <https://click.palletsprojects.com/en/stable/documentation/#help-parameter-customization>`_.

        - ``show_default = True`` (*Click feature*)

          `Show all default values
          <https://click.palletsprojects.com/en/stable/api/#click.Context.show_default>`_
          in help screen.

        Additionally, these `Cloup context settings
        <https://cloup.readthedocs.io/en/stable/pages/formatting.html#formatting-settings>`_
        are set:

        - ``align_option_groups = False`` (*Cloup feature*)

          `Aligns option groups in help screen
          <https://cloup.readthedocs.io/en/stable/pages/option-groups.html#aligned-vs-non-aligned-groups>`_.

        - ``show_constraints = True`` (*Cloup feature*)

          `Show all constraints in help screen
          <https://cloup.readthedocs.io/en/stable/pages/constraints.html#the-constraint-decorator>`_.

        - ``show_subcommand_aliases = True`` (*Cloup feature*)

          `Show all subcommand aliases in help screen
          <https://cloup.readthedocs.io/en/stable/pages/aliases.html?highlight=show_subcommand_aliases#help-output-of-the-group>`_.

        Click Extra also adds its own ``context_settings``:

        - ``show_choices = None`` (*Click Extra feature*)

          If set to ``True`` or ``False``, will force that value on all options, so we
          can globally show or hide choices when prompting a user for input. Only makes
          sense for options whose ``prompt`` property is set.

          Defaults to ``None``, which will leave all options untouched, and let them
          decide of their own ``show_choices`` setting.

        - ``show_envvar = None`` (*Click Extra feature*)

          If set to ``True`` or ``False``, will force that value on all options, so we
          can globally enable or disable the display of environment variables in help
          screen.

          Defaults to ``None``, which will leave all options untouched, and let them
          decide of their own ``show_envvar`` setting. The rationale being that
          discoverability of environment variables is enabled by the ``--show-params``
          option, which is active by default on extra commands. So there is no need to
          surcharge the help screen.

          This addresses the
          `click#2313 issue <https://github.com/pallets/click/issues/2313>`_.

        """Apply configuration values to the parent context's ``default_map``.

        This is the key fix for ``config_option`` with lazy commands. Instead of trying
        to apply config to the command's context (which doesn't exist yet), we apply it
        to the parent context's default_map with the command name as the key.

        When Click later creates the command's context, it will automatically inherit
        this config through Click's standard context inheritance mechanism.
